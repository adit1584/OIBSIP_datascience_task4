# Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

Spam emails often contain phishing links, scams, or misleading content that pose security risks.  
This project builds an **Email Spam Detection System** using **Python and Machine Learning** to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** based on their textual content.

## 🚀 Features
- Email text preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Machine learning-based spam classification
- High accuracy and efficient prediction
- Easy-to-run Python implementation

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data collection and loading
2. Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization)
3. Feature extraction (TF-IDF / Bag of Words)
4. Model training using a classification algorithm
5. Model evaluation and testing
6. Spam prediction on new email samples
